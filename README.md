# EM-Abstract
Machine Learning from Cellular Automata

## Abstract
This proposal aims to introduce the concept of Emergent Models (EMs): dynamical systems inspired by Cellular Automata and Turing Machines that can be used as Machine Learning (ML) models instead of neural networks. By encoding complexity in a large state space and recursively applying a fixed update rule until a halting condition is met, these models aim to emulate modeling and learning behaviors in a fundamentally different way from neural networks and other traditional machine learning models. Current ML models, especially neural networks, usually tend to capture surface patterns rather than achieve true generalization. This shortfall may arise from their reliance on a one-shot, complex, and highly parametric transition function. In contrast, biological systems and physical processes evolve by applying many times a simple transition function on a large state space, much like a Turing machine. EMs, which are inspired by Turing Completeness and use simple local rules applied iteratively over a large state space, offer a highly expressive yet efficient alternative to neural networks. This approach likely reduces overfitting and enhances generalization, making EMs a promising pathway toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Furthermore, due to the inherent flexibility of their architecture, they could present advanced meta-learning capabilities. To leverage all this flexibility, EMs are trained with black box algorithms, like with genetic and Bayesian optimization. We propose to implement and compare EMs on a toy reinforcement learning (RL) task, driving a dummy car in a 2D environment, to evaluate expressivity, stability, learning speed, spontaneous emergence of meta-learning abilities, and searching for the best configurations to allow the model to work and learn efficiently. All findings will then be formalized into a research paper, and we also plan to release a GitHub repository to reproduce our work.
